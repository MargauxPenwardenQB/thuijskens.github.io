title: About me
---

I am Thomas Huijskens, born in the US but brought up in The Netherlands. I am a Data Scientist at [QuantumBlack](https://www.quantumblack.com), and I work and live in London. I'm using this site to occasionally share some of my personal insights and opinions about the world of data science.

I graduated with distinction from the University of Oxford with a masters degree in statistics. Before moving to the fields of statistics and data science, I was mainly interested in stochastic calculus, numerical methods and financial mathematics. I have a BSc degree in Applied Mathematics with distinction from Delft University of Technology, in which I focused heavily on these subjects.

I have also published a paper in these fields, and if you are really interested in that you can read the pre-print [here](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2622452), and find the final published version at the [Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042715005191) (paywall).

If you want to get in touch with me, you can contact me by [email](mailto:thomas_huijskens@hotmail.com), or through my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/thomashuijskens) page. I'm always happy to connect with other people that share my interests.
